\chapter{Preface}

This tutorial is the culmination of nearly a decade of studying and writing
about software freedom licensing and the GPL\@.  Each part of this tutorial
is a course unto itself, educating the reader on a myriad of topics from the
deep details of the GPLv2 and GPLv3, common business models in the copyleft
licensing area (both the friendly and unfriendly kind), best practices for
compliance with the GPL, both for engineers and managers, as well as
real-world case studies of GPL enforcement matters.

It is unlikely that all the information herein is necessary to learn all at
once, and therefore this tutorial likely serves best as a reference book.
The material herein has been used as the basis for numerous live tutorials
and discussion groups since 2002, and the materials have been periodically
updated.   They likely stand on their own as excellent reference material.

However, if you are reading these course materials without attending a live
tutorial session, please note that this material is merely a summary of the
highlights of the various CLE and other tutorial courses based on this
material.  Please be aware that during the actual courses, class discussion
supplements this printed curriculum.  Simply reading it is not equivalent to
attending the course.
