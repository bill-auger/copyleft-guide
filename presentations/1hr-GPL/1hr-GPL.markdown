    + &hellip; and therefore enforcers of those copyrights.

# How this Hour Will Go?

+ Materials presented will mix the simple &amp; complex.

+ We cannot possible cover the entire GPL in one hour.

+ Discuss: motivations, origins, then a few of GPL's sections.

# A Restaurant's Lawyer?

+ Considering why you want to learn this.

+ What if your client was a restaurant?

+ What would you want to need to know?

# Restaurant Lawyer: What'd You Study?

+ If you were a restaurant's lawyer:

+ Probably three areas of law you'd focus on:
     + building codes.
     + health and safety regulations.
     + tax regulations.

+ Who would want to hear from?

# Restaurant Lawyer: What'd You Study?

+ Figure out the motivations behind the building code:
      + What parts are arcane and less important to inspectors?
      + How do inspections work?
      + What are the penalties?

+ Figure out the same for health &amp; safety:
      + Who inspects, and when?
      + What's the health code say, and what checklist do inspectors use?

+ Is there any way the two interrelate?

+ Who is in charge of all this?

+ What was the purpose and intent of these regulations?

# Why Listen To Us?

+ FSF: Understanding the purpose and intent of the GPL.

+ Conservancy &amp; FSF:
    + both enforce the GPL.
    + if your client violates, you will hear from us.
