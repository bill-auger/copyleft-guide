# Non-Copyright Systems

+ Patents, NDAs, &amp; other agreements often impact software.

+ GPL is essentially a copyright license.
     - so, how does GPL handle these systems?

+ As always, GPL has **conditional** permissions.
     - some such conditions relate to these other legal regimes.

+ Compliance for these is much more legalistic than technical.


# GPLv2&sect;7

<span class="fitonslide">
<p>[GPLv2&sect;]7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

# GPLv3 Improvements

+ GPLv3 expands GPLv2&sect;7 into multiple sections.

+ Creates detailed rules.
      - an improvement
      - legal compliance analysis is less complicated.

# Staffing Question

+ In complex environments, both lawyers &amp; developers should analyze
  compliance obligations.

+ Simple environments (i.e., no actual proprietary components in product),
  less expertise &amp; cross-disciplinary staff time needed.
