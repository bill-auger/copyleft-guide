# TODOS

* Document [creating an EPUB](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/use-latex-to-produce-epub)
* Adapt the jQuery UI tooltip hack used for the overlib replacement with
  tex4ht to upstream tex4ht.
* Here's a cute idea: it would be great if copyleft.guide/LABEL from the
  LaTeX sources always went to that place on the HTML version on
  copyleft.org/guide/  I set a few of these up by hand already, but perhaps
  there's a way that tex4ht could dump an list of URL redirects automatically
  when it builds the HTML.
* https://hypothes.is/ might be useful for quickly allowing web readers
  to add changes.
